Sql Challenge Analaysis of Employees data 

It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, I had to design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. 
1. Data modeling, 
2. Data engineering 
3. Data analysis

# Data Modelling 

For Data modelling 
## used quickdatabasediagrams.com and created the following diagram
Created 6 different tables visual and there column names assigned Primary keys for each table and Foreign keys as needed to connect the data. 

Used various data types for different data 






# Data Engineering 

Actually Created the Schema in pgadmin for all the six tables and created Primary Keys ,Foreign keys and composite keys 
1.Departments
2.Dept_employee
3.Manager
4.Employee
5.Salaries
6.Title

Imported the data from the csv files for each respective table mentioned above.
